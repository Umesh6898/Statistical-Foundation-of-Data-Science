üéì Analysis of University Instructor Evaluation Data
üß≠ Purpose

The objective of this exercise is to apply concepts of probability and hypothesis testing to a dataset containing teaching evaluations of university instructors.
This task emphasizes determining the likelihood of certain evaluation outcomes and performing a two-sided hypothesis test using the normal distribution.
Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas were utilized to carry out the computations.

üìä About the Dataset

The dataset, referred to as ratings, captures details about university-level faculty and their teaching performance as rated by students.
It includes both demographic characteristics and academic background information.

Field	Description
Prof	Unique identifier or name of the professor (some professors may appear multiple times)
Gender	Gender of the instructor (Male or Female)
Tenure	Indicates whether the instructor is tenured (Yes) or not (No)
Beauty	A numerical value representing perceived attractiveness
Rating	Average teaching evaluation score (typically ranges from 1 to 5)
Students	Number of students who submitted evaluations
Age	Age of the professor
Division	Specifies if the course taught was lower-division or upper-division
üß∞ Tools and Technologies
Tool/Library	Role
Python 3.x	Main programming language for the analysis
pandas	Used for managing and analyzing structured data
NumPy	Provided support for numerical computations and probability calculations
Matplotlib	Used for basic data visualization
Google Colab	Hosted platform for running code and sharing results interactively
üßæ Summary of Findings

The mean of the evaluation scores was found to be 3.99, with a standard deviation of 0.55.

The probability that a randomly chosen professor received a rating above 4.5 was estimated at 18.2%.

The likelihood of an evaluation score falling within the range 3.5 to 4.2 was approximately 62.5%.

A two-tailed z-test was conducted using a randomly selected sample of 30 ratings.
The test produced a z-score of -0.82 and a p-value of 0.41.

üîç Since the p-value exceeds the standard significance threshold of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
This suggests that the sample mean does not significantly differ from the population mean.

üèÅ Conclusion

This analysis effectively demonstrated how to apply statistical reasoning and inference techniques to real-world educational data. Key takeaways include:

Computing probabilities using the properties of the normal distribution.

Designing and executing a two-sided z-test to compare sample and population means.

Understanding and interpreting statistical outputs such as the z-score and p-value to support decision-making.
