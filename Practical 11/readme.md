Sunspot Statistical Analysis — README
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number dataset from the SILSO World Data Center (Royal Observatory of Belgium). The objective is to study long-term solar activity patterns and model the statistical behavior of sunspot counts.

The analysis includes:

Time-series visualization
Modeling using the Gamma distribution
Splitting data into 12-year solar cycles
Histogram analysis of sunspot counts
Manual Metropolis–Hastings MCMC sampling (without PyMC3)
Posterior estimation and prediction of Gamma parameters a and b
This project answers six structured analytical questions, progressing from exploratory visualization to probabilistic inference.

📂 Dataset Source
The dataset used is the monthly averaged total sunspot number series:

URL: https://www.sidc.be/silso/DATA/SN_m_tot_V2.0.txt

Dataset Columns
year — calendar year
month — calendar month
decimal_date — year in decimal format
sunspot — mean total sunspot count for the month
std — estimated standard deviation
n_obs — number of observations
provisional — flag (1 = provisional)
✅ Q1 — Time-Series Exploration
The dataset is indexed by date and visually inspected to observe long-term behavior. This reveals the well-known solar cycle pattern, approximately repeating every 11 years.

✅ Q2 — Gamma Modeling by 12-Year Solar Cycles
To study distributional changes over time, the dataset is divided into 12-year segments. A Gamma distribution is fitted to each block, providing cycle-specific shape (a) and scale (b) parameters.

Zero sunspot months are excluded because Gamma likelihood estimation requires strictly positive values.

✅ Q3 — Histogram of Sunspot Counts
A histogram helps assess skewness, spread, and suitability of the Gamma model. Sunspot counts are highly right-skewed, supporting the choice of a Gamma distribution.

✅ Q4 — Manual MCMC Without PyMC3
Bayesian inference is performed using a custom Metropolis–Hastings sampler, not relying on PyMC3 or ArviZ. The prior distribution is:

shape a ~ Gamma(4, 10)
rate b ~ Gamma(4, 10)
Posterior sampling is conducted separately for:

the first 50 observations
the full dataset
the last 50 observations
Each group’s parameter uncertainty and convergence are studied.

✅ Q5 — Trace & Posterior Visualization
Trace plots show sampler movement across iterations, assessing mixing and convergence. Posterior histograms display estimated distributions of a and b after discarding burn-in samples.

✅ Q6 — Predictive Parameter Estimates
Posterior means and credible intervals for a and b are computed. These summarize estimates of the underlying solar activity distribution and allow prediction of expected monthly sunspot counts.

✅ Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
No Bayesian libraries required.

✅ Key Insights
🌞 Sunspot behavior is cyclical and non-linear 📈 The distribution is right-skewed — Gamma is appropriate 🔁 Solar cycles differ statistically over time 🎯 Bayesian inference quantifies uncertainty effectively 🧠 Manual MCMC avoids reliance on external probabilistic frameworks
